Terminal tic-tac-toe single game

My first golang programm.
I will be glad to criticism

# todo
1) Add mechanism to identify which "lines" on a board can never be winning because they contain at least 1 of both players' pieces. These are cached to prevent future checks of that line and improve speed.
2) Ignore expensive win check if there are not enough pieces for a win to be possible (while following the rules). For example, the soonest a player could win on a 3x3 board is when marking the 5th square.
3) dumbass bot which will play with me ^~^
